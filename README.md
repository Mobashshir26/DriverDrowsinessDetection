# DriverDrowsinessDetection
# Overview
Driver drowsiness is a major cause of road accidents globally. This project aims to mitigate this risk by developing a machine learning model that can detect signs of drowsiness in drivers. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze facial landmarks and eye states to predict drowsiness.
